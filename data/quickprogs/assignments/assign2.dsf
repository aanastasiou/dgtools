# Assigning to expression 1
# Or what in a higher level language
# would be written as:

# unsigned char R0=1, R1=42
# ...
# R0 = R1

# Obviously an "expression" is not visible here.
# But, at the ASM level the expression itself 
# has to be explicitly evaluated and this would 
# still be the last step in order to send the 
# result of the expression from some temporary 
# register to the variable
