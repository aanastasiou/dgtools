Heads Up Display
================

This is a short note on how to turn your Digirule 2U to an auxiliary little display for up to 2 different parameters.

With this program, the Digirule 2U is used to display up to 2 values simultaneously, right from the command line.

You can use it to display all sorts of things such as your battery charge level, whether you have new email and any 
other "event" you can describe with an integer number from 0 to 255.
