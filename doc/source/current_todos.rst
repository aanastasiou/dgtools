Current TODO List
=================

The following is an automatically generated list of TODO items from the source code.

Anyone wishing to get involved with the project could well start on implementing a new feature, or address one of 
these existing TODO items.

The convention to mark a TODO item in the code is the ``# TODO:`` prefix, followed by ``HIGH, MED, LOW`` which is a 
very simple indicator of urgency.

    * ``HIGH`` are items that should be addressed by the next round of edits / release
    * ``MED`` are items that **might** require some form of re-design to be applied and require more long-term thinking.
    * ``LOW`` are items that would be good to have at some point in the future but are not immediately required to 
      deliver a specific piece of functionality.
      
The following list has been produced with the ``doc/get_todos.sh`` script and is formatted in the standard ``egrep -Hn``
output format.
