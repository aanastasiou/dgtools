Writing programs for the Digirule2
==================================

Digirule2 is a fantastic tool for learning the basics of "programmable" digital circuits. Its most useful 
characteristic is exactly the lack of features and convenience that can result in some fantastic brainteasers.

The following is a list of programs I wrote for my Digirule2, using ``dgtools``. Each one of these articles 
covers (briefly) the theory of operation and some of the details that shaped the code.

There are very few things that the Digirule cannot do, in terms of computation and from a practical point of view, 
its only limit seems to be its tiny memory space.
