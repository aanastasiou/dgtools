Digirule ASM Examples
=====================

Digirule2 is a fantastic tool for learning about "programmable" digital circuits. Its most useful 
characteristic is exactly the lack of features and convenience that can result in some fantastic brainteasers.

The following is a list of programs I wrote for the Digirule2, using ``dgtools``. Each example 
is meant to provide a little insight on how certain things can be expressed in ASM, or how they 
end up looking like in ASM.

There are very few things that the Digirule cannot do, in terms of computation. From a practical point of view, 
its only limit seems to be its memory space.

But before crying out for "more memory", let's see what can be said in 256 bytes:
