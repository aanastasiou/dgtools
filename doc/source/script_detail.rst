Detailed Script Descriptions
============================

At the moment this section includes the help sections of each script as it would have been obtained via a 
``> ./[script.py] --help`` call.

``dgasm.py``
============

.. automodule:: dgasm


``dginspect.py``
================

.. automodule:: dginspect


``dgsim.py``
============

.. automodule:: dgsim

.. note::

    For an example of ``dgsim`` output, please see `this Markdown file <_static/simpleadd_2_trace.md>`_ 
    which is what is primarily generated from that script. The same Markdown file through pandoc, 
    is available via `this link <_static/simpleadd_2_trace.html>`_.
    
    These indicative outputs are generated by the example in section :ref:`simple_add_with_mem`.
