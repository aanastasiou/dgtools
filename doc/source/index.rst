Welcome to dgtools's documentation!
===================================

.. image:: _static/my_digirule2.jpeg

``dgtools`` is composed of an assembler (``dgasm``), a binary file "inspector" (``dginspect``) and a simulator
(``dgsim``) that can be used together to develop code for the `Digirule 2 <https://bradsprojects.com/digirule2/>`_
hardware.

For an example of the level of detail of program execution, please see 
`this sample output file <_static/simpleadd_2_trace.html>`_ and keep reading through the introductory section to 
generate traces of your own code.
