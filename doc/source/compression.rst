Code compression
================

*"What can you do with 256 bytes of code?"*

This question has underpinned many of the Digirule programs in these pages. But, it does not have to be this way.

In this section, we go through data compression in order to fit even more code within these 256 bytes.

This is possible because of two reasons:

#. The structure of the instruction set.
#. The structure of programs.

In other words, in this section, we exploit the redundancy in the instruction set itself as well as the way instructions
are put together to structure a program, to fit more code in less space.
