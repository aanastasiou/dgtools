# Brainfuck examples

* `add_two_nums.bfc`
    * Asks for two numbers from the user and produces their sum

* `bf_equals.bfc`
    * The Brainfuck way of setting a cell equal to the value of 
      another cell.
    * This is also the default example that will be compiled 
      if you run ``make html`` in this directory

* `bf_code.bfc`
    * Contains the `bf_equals.bfc` example. This is the default 
      Brainfuck source code file which `dgtools` uses to produce 
      the Assembly, binary, hex and trace HTML from. See also
      `Makefile`.
