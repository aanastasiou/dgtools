# Digirule ASM examples

To run the examples in this section, please make sure that `dgtools` is installed.

If you are in Linux, with `make` installed, you can generate and browse the HTML 
trace files by calling:

```
    > make html
```

...from within each subdirectory

This starts a browser directly to the HTML file. Running ``make clean`` erases the 
files that are produced during compilation of individual source code files.
